/**
 * A ClassSharer allows to share java classes across the different plugins.
 * <h2>How class sharing works</h2>
 * <p>
 * A SharedClassLoader is a plugin's ClassLoader with an additional public method
 * {@link SharedClassLoader#findClass(String, boolean)}. It is associated with a ClassSharer. When asked for a
 * class by the plugin, a SharedClassFinder asks the ClassSharer via {@link #getClass(String)}. The
 * {@link #getClass(String)} method loops though all SharedClassFinder to find the corresponding class. In
 * that way, when a plugin needs a class, it may be located in another plugin. Provided that the two plugins'
 * ClassLoaders are SharedClassFinder and have the same ClassSharer, and were added to it with
 * {@link #addClassLoader(SharedClassLoader)}.
 * </p>
